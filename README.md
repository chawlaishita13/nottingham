# Exploratory analysis, data collection, pre-processing, and discussion

## Context

The Nottingham dataset is a well-known collection of approximately 1,200 British and American folk tunes, primarily in the form of melodies with accompanying chord progressions. It was curated by Dr. David Seymour for the purpose of computer-based music analysis and automatic harmonization tasks. The dataset is often used in research for melody generation, chord prediction, and symbolic music modeling.​


The dataset is primarily distributed in both ABC and MIDI notation. Each file typically contains a melody line and corresponding chord labels. These tunes are traditional in nature and offer a wide range of rhythmic patterns, melodic contours, and harmonic structures, making it an excellent resource for studying symbolic music generation tasks.


## Discussion

We utilized the Nottingham Folk Music Dataset in its pre-processed form from the cleaned version available in the jukedeck nottingham dataset. The dataset is provided in MIDI and ABC notation format—which simplifies parsing and analysis.​

The original Nottingham dataset contained raw ABC files with inconsistencies in formatting, key signatures, and chord annotations. The Jukedeck version has addressed these issues by:​
Standardizing key signatures and normalizing chord symbols.​
Removing duplicate or corrupted entries.​
Aligning chords and melodies for accurate harmonic pairing.​
Ensuring consistent syntax, enabling smooth conversion into machine-readable structures.​

As a result, no additional cleaning or correction was necessary. This cleaned dataset ensures a uniform and reliable foundation for both exploratory analysis and model development.​


# MODELING

## Context
In symbolic, unconditioned music generation, we treat each Nottingham tune as a sequence of discrete musical events. Formally, let x=(x1,x2,…,xT) be a sequence where each xt ​is a symbol drawn from a finite vocabulary. The learning objective is to model the joint distribution.

- Inputs: At training time, we feed the model sliding windows of past tokens.
- Outputs: The model predicts a probability distribution over the next token. 
- Objective: We optimize the negative log-likelihood (cross-entropy) over the training set.

Equivalently, the network is trained to minimize the cross-entropy between the “true” next token and the predicted softmax distribution.
Markov Chains, Recurrent Neural Networks and Transformer based sequence models are suitable for our task. The Nottingham dataset consists of ~1,200 monophonic folk melodies, each represented as a sequence of pitch + duration tokens. We trained an LSTM on these sequences.

## Discussion
For Nottingham’s dataset, an LSTM was relatively simple to implement, trained in reasonable time, and produced locally coherent folk‐style melodies.
If we had access to multiple GPUs, a Transformer could have outperformed an RNN.
VAEs offer latent‐space exploration benefits but we did not need to blend the folk tunes. It would have introduced significant complexity in training unnecessarily.

# EVALUATION

## CONTEXT
##### Model Objective:
- The LSTM is trained to predict the next token in a symbolic music sequence.
- It minimizes categorical cross-entropy, encouraging frequent patterns from the training data

##### Musical Properties for Evaluation:
- Pitch Range: Affects expressiveness and melodic contour.
- Entropy: Reflects diversity and novelty in note choices.
- Repetition Ratio: Reveals balance between structure and variety.

##### Limitations:
- These metrics don’t fully capture musicality e.g., harmonic rules, phrase structure, or emotional tone.
- A sequence with low loss can still sound mechanical or boring.
##### Subjective Evaluation:
- Human listeners value surprise, coherence, and emotion, which are not directly optimized.
- Hence, objective accuracy ≠ musical quality, highlighting the gap between prediction performance and artistic output.


## DISCUSSION AND BASELINES

To validate our LSTM’s performance, we compare it to two trivial generation methods:

Random Baseline: Notes are randomly sampled from the training vocabulary (uniform distribution). This tends to produce high entropy but low musical coherence.


Markov Chain: A 1st-order transition model is built on training note sequences. While more structured than pure random, it lacks long-term context awareness.

# Random Sampling Baseline

This baseline randomly samples pitches from the training vocabulary.


# First-Order Markov Model Baseline

Builds a transition matrix from training data and generates based on current note's probabilities.

# Observations

LSTM outperforms both baselines in terms of repetition avoidance and controlled diversity.


Markov shows moderate structure but often gets stuck in repetitive patterns.


Random baseline is overly chaotic and musically uninteresting.

# TASK 2

# Modeling

## Context
In conditioned symbolic music generation, the model generates each note or chord token based on both the previous sequence and a conditioning chord input, aiming to produce musically coherent sequences that follow the provided harmonic context. The objective is to minimize categorical cross-entropy loss between predicted and actual tokens, encouraging the model to accurately capture musical structure and chord relationships. LSTMs are particularly effective here because they can model long-term dependencies and incorporate conditioning information, while Markov chains serve as a simpler baseline that only models local transitions without explicit chord awareness

## Discussion
LSTM models require careful preparation of input sequences and vocabularies, Markov Chains are limited in musical expressiveness, and Transformers, while powerful, pose significant implementation and resource challenges for this domain

# Evaluation

## Context
The model’s objective is extended to include conditioning, such as chords, which should guide the generated melody. We use both statistical and musical metrics (like pitch entropy and scale consistency) to evaluate outputs, but acknowledge these do not fully capture subjective musical quality. Human listening remains essential to bridge the gap between objective metrics and perceived music.

## Discussion and Baselines
The random baseline samples notes without considering sequence history or chord conditions, resulting in high diversity but low musical coherence. The Markov chain baseline predicts the next note based on previous transitions, offering more structure than random but still lacking long-term context and condition awareness. In contrast, the conditioned LSTM uses both sequence history and explicit chord conditioning, producing outputs that are musically coherent and responsive to the given harmonic context.

## Implementation
For evaluation, we computed objective metrics like pitch entropy and scale consistency across all models. The conditioned LSTM achieved the lowest pitch entropy (2.04) and perfect scale consistency (1.00), indicating structured and harmonically accurate outputs. The random baseline had the highest entropy (3.52) and poor scale consistency (0.59), reflecting high diversity but little musical coherence. The Markov chain fell in between, showing moderate structure but less adherence to harmonic conditions than the conditioned LSTM
